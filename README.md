<h1>FakeWikiHow</h1>
 The aim of the project was to create a website that provide random information like Wikihow. I did this project with three other girl(Denise O Brien, Elisa) with code first girl which help to learn the basic of web developing. 
 Each of us did 2 page and did a javascript function. For me i did a comment section. Every 2 week or week. My team and I have a mini meeting about how we are going to do the project.
